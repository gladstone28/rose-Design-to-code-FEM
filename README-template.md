## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned


To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

This is the place to go to learn markdown [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/).


### Continued development

The more challenges I do contrbutes to my increased knowledge. My expertise in the use of VS Studio Code has also improved dramatically


### Useful resources
